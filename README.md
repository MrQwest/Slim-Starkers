**What it has**

* No style. No CSS at all actually. This is by design. BY own prefrence is commented out in `<head>`
* An extra settings page for theme-specific settings (only has a Google Analytics UA box as default)
* Nested comments
* Menu-highlighting fix, useful or custom post types
* Removes 'generator' meta tag from `<head>`

**Useful working functions:**

* Convert numbers to words, so '7' becomes 'Seven'
* Add `has-parent` to `wp_nav_menu` lists that have children
* Add `first-menu-item` and `last-menu-item` to `wp_nav_menu` lists
* Trim strings by word count
* Get the content by ID as object, not echoed out
* Change `?s=` to `search` in URLs
* Insert featured images in RSS feeds
* Different default excerpt 'Read More' text

**A vast set of (commented out) helper functions:**

* Hide admin bar
* Change number of search results shown on a page
* Change number of archive items shown on a page
* Rename 'Post' to 'Article' in Admin menus
* Force maintenance mode for non-admins
* Show custom warning in Admin
